# Backworks Issue Tracker

This document serves as a centralized issue tracker for the Backworks API platform. Issues are organized by component and priority.

## Current Issues

### Critical (Must Fix)

- [x] **BP-001**: Fix remaining integration tests in `capture_integration_tests.rs`
  - Root cause: Include patterns in test were not matching all intended paths
  - Affected files: `src/capture.rs`, `tests/capture_integration_tests.rs`
  - Resolution: Fixed glob pattern matching logic and path comparison in capture.rs

- [ ] **BP-002**: Update binary target imports and configuration references
  - Root cause: Module imports in `main.rs` and binary components need updating
  - Affected files: `src/main.rs`, `src/config.rs`

### High Priority

- [ ] **BP-003**: Remove all remaining mock or placeholder references
  - Root cause: Some mock references may still be present in tests or documentation
  - Affected files: Various test files, documentation

- [ ] **BP-004**: Update all example configurations to use proxy mode by default
  - Root cause: Some example configs may still reference mock mode
  - Affected files: Files in `examples/` directory

- [ ] **BP-005**: Implement proper structured logging
  - Root cause: Currently using `println!` for debugging
  - Affected files: Multiple source files

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **BP-006**: Complete implementation of resilient plugin execution
  - Root cause: Need to finalize the circuit breaker pattern
  - Affected files: `src/resilience.rs`, `src/plugin.rs`

- [ ] **BP-007**: Update documentation for mock-free architecture
  - Root cause: Some docs may still reference mock mode
  - Affected files: Multiple markdown files

- [ ] **BP-008**: Add proper field prefixes for unused variables
  - Root cause: Some unused variables are causing warnings
  - Affected files: `src/plugin.rs`, `src/database.rs`, `src/capture.rs`

### Low Priority

- [ ] **BP-009**: Enhance test coverage for proxy functionality
  - Root cause: Tests focus mostly on mock functionality
  - Affected files: Test files

- [ ] **BP-010**: Optimize performance for large request/response payloads
  - Root cause: Current implementation may not be optimized for large payloads
  - Affected files: `src/proxy.rs`, `src/capture.rs`

## Completed Issues

- [x] **BP-000**: Remove `src/mock.rs` module
  - Resolution: Module completely removed, all references updated

- [x] **BP-011**: Complete dashboard integration with live backend data
  - Root cause: Dashboard was displaying mock/simulated data instead of real proxy metrics
  - Affected files: `dashboard/index.html`, `src/dashboard.rs`, `src/server.rs`, `src/engine.rs`
  - Resolution: Integrated dashboard request recording into main request handler, implemented REST/WebSocket APIs, and created production-ready UI with real-time monitoring, notifications, themes, and export functionality

- [x] **BP-012**: Successfully implement dashboard integration with live backend data
  - Root cause: Dashboard integration was completed in previous iteration, but needed testing and polish
  - Affected files: All dashboard and backend integration files
  - Resolution: Tested full stack integration, confirmed real-time metrics tracking, dashboard UI working properly with live data from proxy requests
  - Status: âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
