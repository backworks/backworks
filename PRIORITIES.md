# 🎯 Backworks Development Priorities

**Updated: June 19, 2025**  
**Focus: YAML → Backend API Excellence**

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)**

### 1. **🔧 Core Functionality Polish**
- [ ] **Fix runtime execution** - Ensure JavaScript handlers work reliably
- [ ] **Test all examples** - Verify hello-world, blog-api, task-manager work
- [ ] **Dashboard improvements** - Make metrics actually functional
- [ ] **Error handling** - Better error messages for YAML issues

### 2. **📖 Essential Documentation**
- [ ] **Update quick-start.md** - Step-by-step working example
- [ ] **Complete configuration.md** - All YAML options documented
- [ ] **Fix example READMEs** - Ensure commands and outputs match reality
- [ ] **Add troubleshooting guide** - Common issues and solutions

### 3. **🧪 Validation & Testing**
- [ ] **Integration tests** - Automated testing of examples
- [ ] **CLI validation** - Proper error handling for malformed configs
- [ ] **Cross-platform testing** - Ensure it works on Mac/Linux/Windows

---

## 📋 **Medium-Term Goals (Next Month)**

### 4. **🏗️ Architecture Solidification**
- [ ] **Runtime optimization** - Faster JavaScript execution
- [ ] **Config validation** - Better YAML schema validation
- [ ] **Performance baseline** - Establish performance expectations
- [ ] **Memory management** - Optimize for development use cases

### 5. **👥 Developer Experience**
- [ ] **Hot reload** - Config changes without restart
- [ ] **Better logs** - Clearer development feedback
- [ ] **Template generation** - `backworks init` command
- [ ] **VS Code extension** - YAML autocompletion

---

## 🎯 **Issue Tracking Strategy**

### **GitHub Issues Categories**
```
🐛 Bug - Something broken
🚀 Enhancement - Improve existing feature  
📖 Documentation - Docs improvements
🎯 Core - YAML→API core functionality
📊 Dashboard - Monitoring improvements
🧪 Testing - Test coverage/automation
🎮 Examples - Example improvements
```

### **Priority Labels**
```
P0 - Blocks core functionality
P1 - Important for usability  
P2 - Nice to have
P3 - Future consideration
```

---

## 📊 **Optimal Documentation Approach**

### **Keep Simple & Focused**
1. **README.md** - Quick intro (✅ Done)
2. **DIRECTION.md** - Architecture clarity (✅ Done) 
3. **docs/quick-start.md** - Working example in 5 minutes
4. **docs/configuration.md** - Complete YAML reference
5. **examples/** - Learn by doing

### **Avoid Documentation Debt**
- ❌ Don't document features that don't work yet
- ❌ Don't create complex architecture docs
- ❌ Don't duplicate information across files
- ✅ Keep examples as the primary documentation
- ✅ Update docs when features change
- ✅ Test all documentation examples

---

## 🔄 **Development Workflow**

### **Weekly Cycle**
```
Monday: Review priorities & issues
Tuesday-Thursday: Core development  
Friday: Testing & documentation
Weekend: Community feedback review
```

### **Each Feature Must Have**
1. **Working example** in examples/
2. **Documentation** in appropriate doc
3. **Integration test** (automated)
4. **Error handling** with clear messages

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Core Metrics (Track Weekly)**
- ⏱️ **Time to first API** - From clone to working endpoint
- 🐛 **Issue resolution time** - Average time to fix bugs
- 📖 **Documentation accuracy** - Do examples actually work?
- 👥 **Developer feedback** - Are people actually using it?

### **Quality Gates**
- ✅ All examples must work with current code
- ✅ Quick-start must complete in under 5 minutes
- ✅ No breaking changes without major version bump
- ✅ All features must have tests

---

## 🚀 **Next Actions (This Week)**

### **Day 1-2: Fix Core**
1. **Test current examples** - Do they actually work?
2. **Fix runtime execution** - JavaScript handlers must work
3. **Validate dashboard** - API endpoints should return real data

### **Day 3-4: Document Reality**
1. **Update quick-start.md** - With actual working commands
2. **Test all README instructions** - Every curl command must work
3. **Fix configuration.md** - Match actual config schema

### **Day 5: Validate & Plan**
1. **Integration test suite** - Automated validation
2. **Create issue backlog** - From testing discoveries
3. **Next week planning** - Based on what we learned

## 🎯 **Focus Mantras**

> **"Make it work, then make it good, then make it fast"**

> **"Every feature must have a working example"**

> **"Documentation that doesn't work is worse than no documentation"**

> **"Simple beats complex, working beats perfect"**

---

**Priority: Get the current scope working perfectly before adding new features.**
