# Mock-Free Architecture

As of version 0.2.0, Backworks has moved to a fully functional, mock-free architecture. This means:

- The default execution mode is now `proxy` instead of `mock`
- All placeholder/mock code has been removed
- The system uses real HTTP proxying for all functionality
- Tests have been updated to use real proxy handlers

## Changes Made

1. Removed `mock.rs` module
2. Changed default execution mode to `proxy`
3. Updated server.rs to use ProxyHandler for all endpoints
4. Added `handle_request_data` method to ProxyHandler for compatibility
5. Marked MockConfig and MockResponse as deprecated
6. Updated all tests to use real HTTP proxying

## Architecture Benefits

- Simpler code base with fewer modes and fallback patterns
- Real HTTP traffic handling for all endpoints
- Consistent behavior across all usage modes
- Better test coverage of actual functionality

## Migration Guide

If you've been using mock mode:

1. Update your configuration files to use `mode: proxy`
2. Configure proxy targets for each endpoint
3. Remove any mock-specific configuration
4. Deploy external services or use tools like Wiremock for testing

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced proxy target configuration
- Circuit breaker and resilience patterns
- Enhanced capture and replay functionality
