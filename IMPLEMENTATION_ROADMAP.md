## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Core Resilience
1. **Plugin Error Isolation** - Prevent plugin failures from affecting core
2. **Circuit Breaker Implementation** - Auto-disable failing plugins
3. **Resource Limits** - Prevent plugins from consuming excessive resources

### Day 3-4: Code Quality
1. **Remove Deprecated Code** - Clean up ai_old.rs and TODOs
2. **Implement Real Plugin Logic** - Replace placeholder implementations
3. **Add Proper Logging** - Replace debug prints with structured logging

### Day 5-7: Testing & Validation
